# ShoppingList|Planner

This is a shopping list app project that was created using Python based Django framework. It is a very basic app that allows a user to perform full CRUD functionality. The programming languages used for the development of this app are a combination of HTML, CSS & JavaScript for the front-end and Python based Django framework for the back-end development. It provides the following templates to the user:
i. 

The purpose of this app is to take off the hassle of manually writing down shopping list either for the home or office when going shopping. It rather automates this monotonous everyday task and gives the user the opportunity to reuse a single list over and over again by updating it as at when needed which gives it the added advantage over the manual pen & paper list thereby making shopping pleasurable and enjoyable. 
The user interacts with the app through the GUI interface i.e front-end templates designed for each functionality such as add, edit, view or delete an item/a list and are also protected through authentication so that no unauthorised person will have access to the contents in the list.
